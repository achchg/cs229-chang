# Centralizing Real World Data with Machines

This was originally a course project of mine from CS-229 Fall 2021. As there were advanced goals I'd love to explore, continuing them here as research blogs.

Notes for the future self or people that find this project interesting:

- Minimum evironmental pre-requisites are in `environmenta.yml`.
- Conda environment setup:

    ````
    conda env create
    conda activate local_gan
    ````
- Setup a ipykernel ` python -m ipykernel install --user --name local_gan`
